      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I am a computer science student at UHD. During my time at university, I worked on a variety of projects including a mobile app to create an online marketplace for local buyers and sellers and a website for booking travel accommodations. I am skilled in languages such as Java, Python, C++ and HTML/CSS, and I am always looking to learn more and improve my skills.</p>

      <h3>> trustNdeal C2C Marketplace Android App</h3>
      <p>trustNdeal is a mobile application that aims to provide a more secure and reliable platform for buying and selling goods. Similar to OfferUp or Facebook marketplace, trustNdeal allows users to browse, post, and purchase items from local sellers. However, trustNdeal differentiates itself by offering additional security features to ensure a safe and trustworthy transaction for both buyers and sellers.</p>
      <h3>> Travel Booking Website</h3>
      <p>This is a website for booking travel accommodations. It allows users to search for and book hotels, flights, and rental cars, as well as view travel deals and discounts. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <h3>> S&P 500 Index Options Data Scraping and Processing</h3>
      <p>In this project, I used Selenium WebDriver, Pandas, and openpyxl to scrape S&P 500 Index options data from the Barchart website. The purpose of this project was to retrieve the data on the put and call volume, open interest, and average at-the-money volatility for different expiration dates. The data was then processed, cleaned, and saved to an Excel file.</p>
      <h3>> Stock Price Prediction Model</h3>
      <p>This is a machine learning model for predicting stock prices. It uses historical data and various financial indicators to make predictions about the future performance of stocks. Technologies used include Python and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.</p>
